        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
          TechCon's remarkable journey began in 1987 when visionary technologist
          Martha Chen opened her Silicon Valley garage to a small group of
          computing enthusiasts. What started as informal weekend discussions
          about emerging PC technologies has evolved into one of the world's
          most influential technology conferences, shaping industry trends and
          fostering innovation for nearly four decades. From those humble
          beginnings with just 12 attendees, TechCon has grown to attract over
          30,000 participants annually across multiple global locations. The
          conference has witnessed and often predicted major technological
          shifts, from the early days of personal computing through the internet
          revolution, mobile computing, social media integration, and today's
          AI-driven landscape. Throughout its evolution, TechCon has maintained
          its founding principle of bringing together diverse voices in
          technology - from seasoned industry veterans to bright-eyed students,
          from established corporations to disruptive startups. This unique
          blend of perspectives continues to drive the meaningful conversations
          and breakthrough collaborations that define the TechCon experience.
